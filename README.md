# Transit Management System by Lakshay and Karan

Peel Transit Information

The reason to select this topic is because transit is the need of many people and there should be  
app or something through which people can get all the information of employees
buses as well as the fare rates of all types of transit in a particular region.

In this Object Oriented Programming principles are considered such as Inheritance 
as we all know that inheritance allows for a neat and clean code so that we
should not have to copy code from one class to other instead in this class can inherit behaviours from the other 
Apart from that in our application we keep our code neat and clean so that the code is readable to others.
In this we also used methods and in our app there is no need for the condional execution so this 
shows polyorphism. We only give the main details rathar providing unneccesary information this 
shows abstraction.This app is safe and no one can misuse the data so this shows the cocept of Encapsulation
